Differs from CC 0 in that I don't want you to post content to some of the sites I don't like (see the end for details).
This license is subject to CC 0 when you are not involved in posting licensed content to sites that I prohibit, and you do not need to ask me for permission to use it as you see fit.
The list of sites will be updated from time to time.
In the unfortunate event that you post a site that is included in the list:
